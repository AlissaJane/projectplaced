    <h3>Household appliances</h3>
    <p> Michael Critchon said that science discoveries and inventions will go away. Women still have to spend all day in the kitchen cooking and cleaning. Since science discoveries and inventions have not changed that and cannot change it then we will just do away with it. He does not realize that women had to spend all day washing clothes. Kneading bread and churning butter would take hours! Science discoveries and inventions have <strong>definately</strong> improved women's livelihood for the better. Because of the washing machine, the microwave, and prepackaged butter, among other things we have time for better things. We have time to play with our children. Time to help them improve their brain development. In the age of information parents learn about how to help their children with their gross and fine motor skills. We women are able to work outside the home and still cook and clean for our families. </p>
    <h3>Industrial Robots<h3>
      <p>Factories are using robots to build their product. Some people are against robots, enraged they are taking peoples jobs. It is a great thing to be productive and create more things for more people. There will always be a need to hire people in certain fields. SOme fields need human interaction and will never be replaced by robots. Social workers, group home employees, construction workers, cooks, nutritionists, nurses, policemen, fireman, authors, to name a few. It is a good things to automate things that can be, like automative building. 
      <h3>Technology that helps the disabled</h3>
      <p>Have you ever felt limited in any way? Have you ever had to depend on another person for something that you could not do for yourself? I am filled with so much love at the thought that people are making devices to help those that have physical impairments</p>
